## Overview
**Skin-Wound-Detection** is a state-of-the-art developer toolkit designed to streamline wound assessment workflows through **machine learning**, **secure API development**, and **medical image analysis**. Tailored for developers building healthcare applications, this project integrates advanced AI models with robust backend services to enable automated, accurate wound detection and diagnosis.

### Why Skin-Wound-Detection?
This toolkit empowers developers to create intelligent, secure, and scalable applications for medical diagnostics. Its core features include:

- üß¨ **Model Development & Visualization**: Utilizes TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib to develop and visualize wound detection models.
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Implements JWT-based user management and hashing utilities for secure access control.
- üñºÔ∏è **Medical Image Analysis**: Leverages Google‚Äôs GenAI models for precise skin condition diagnosis from uploaded images.
- üíæ **Data Persistence**: Employs PostgreSQL for reliable storage of user data and diagnostic results.
- üöÄ **Scalable API**: Built with FastAPI, supporting asynchronous operations and seamless environment management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use **Skin-Wound-Detection**, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Package Manager**: Pip
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Optional**: Virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) for dependency isolation

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up **Skin-Wound-Detection** from source:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   ‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/jdesai05/Skin-Wound-Detection
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   ‚ùØ cd Skin-Wound-Detection
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   ‚ùØ python -m venv venv
   ‚ùØ source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   ‚ùØ pip install -r models/requirements.txt backend/requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
To run the project, execute the main entry point:
```bash
‚ùØ python main.py
```
Ensure your PostgreSQL database is configured and running. Update the configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml` or environment variables) with your database credentials and API settings.

### Testing
**Skin-Wound-Detection** uses the **pytest** framework for testing. To run the test suite:
```bash
‚ùØ pytest
```
Ensure all dependencies are installed, and the test environment is properly configured.
